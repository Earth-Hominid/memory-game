## Description

A memory game in which the player is shown randomly selected cards. Upon starting the game, the order of the cards is randomized and re-displayed. The players objective is to select the cards in sequence of their orignal order.

This application is built with the React framework, utilizing functional components and React Hooks. I enjoyed building this application as it forced me to learn the following lessons regarding state in React:

- How setting state triggers - rerenders
- When and how state updates
- The reasons state does not update immediately once it is set
- The way in which event handlers access a "snapshot" of the current state.
